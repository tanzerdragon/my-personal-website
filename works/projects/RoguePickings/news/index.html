                        <p>As the summer time comes to a close, we have a number fall harvests coming in from our favorite local farms. Some of our favorites include butternut squash spaghetti sauce with a kick, and zuchini -- fried or baked -- all around.
                          Come check us out and taste our new pumpkin specials, and squash entrees and sides.

                        <p>The kids are out of school, the weather grows warmer, and wedding bells can be heard in the distance. The smell of barbeque makes our tongues salivate, with a side of fresh corn on the cob, and watermelon juice freshly made.
                            We just love the bountiful produce we get each year when the summer brings in ripe fruits and vegetables. Everything is practically in season! That's why we are excited to share with you a birthday event we catered for Tommy and his party of 12 hungry little friends.
                            All in the comfort of their backyard. As we helped catered the meals to his birthday, we were thrilled to provide the nourishment needed for every growing twelve-year old. Cheers!
