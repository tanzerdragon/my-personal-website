                  <h3>Who We Are and what we love to do!</h3>
                  <p>We, like all food trucks, started with an idea and humble beginnings, established in early 2018. We decided that although there are many great food trucks out there, none of them quite cater to the needs of health conscious, hungry people.
                  We love to deliver quality, farm-local food to the people who love it the most! As the saying goes, "what we are is what we eat!" And what we eat makes us happy, healthy, and balanced.
                  Our food brings us closer to our communities, and what we eat affects our bodies in so many ways. That's why, we love advocating and delivering the foods we make! Our current goals is to deliver to as many people as possible that only a food truck can do.
                  Let it be known that we are in the works of securing a local eatery as soon as we get the funding we need!
